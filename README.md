# Community Hub

Community Hub is a centralized platform designed to help individuals discover and connect with communities based on shared interests. The platform acts as a structured discovery layer, while real-time interactions and discussions take place within dedicated Discord servers.

The core objective of this project is to build a scalable community ecosystem and establish a strong, engaged user base for future initiatives and product launches.

## Overview
